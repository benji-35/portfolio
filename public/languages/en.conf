myHistory=Born the 1st January 2002 in France,<br><br>I followed the general courses of the French school system. I obtained my baccalaureate in 2019 with honors.<br><br>I joined a computer programming school called Epitech in Rennes in 2020.<br><br>In 2018 I joined French Lifeguard (SNSM). During Summer I'm on beaches to save people and for the rest of the year I'm in rescue post or in ambulance.<br>With this I learned what give your life for others did mean. This passion takes me a lot of time.<br><br>From young to my 19 I was in swimming club with a regional level.
